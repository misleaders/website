Dear Southeast/South Asian students who are interested in Japan, <br>
<br>
This summer, we'll  hold a 10-day program in Tokyo. We'll invite Southeast/ South Asian students. You can get great experience and discuss social problems with excellent students from different cultural backgrounds. You can also get some financial support!<br>
Check it out!!!!↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓<br>
<br>
MIS(Multilateral Interaction with Students) is the organizer of this program. It consists mainly of students of the University of Tokyo. We are discussing and making projects on social problems of Southeast /South Asia countries.<br>
 <br>
The theme of our project this year is "Beyond the Border". Here, we'll discuss the problems that a person with disability faces. <br>
<br>
What do you usually do when you meet a person with disability?<br>
<br>
Do you think our society is good to live in for persons with disabilities?<br>
<br>
What can we do to make the world where they can equally and actively live?<br>
<br>
What Tokyo will be like in 2020, when the Tokyo Paralympics is held?<br>
<br>
Let's join this program and discuss them together!!!<br>
